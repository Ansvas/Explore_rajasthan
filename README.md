General Information-
----
This is the project made by me and my team mates in Rajasthan-Digifest Udaipur-2017. By this project we are trying to solve problems faced
by Tourist and trying to promote rajasthan tourism places and products.

Tech Stack-
----
We are making web portal for vendors for submitting details of product available, address. To store the data we are using we are using
firebase as the database here. For tourist we are making an android app which retrive data from firebase and show vendor details in the
app. On the other side we are also using google Map API for showing location of vendor, register touts, and near by maps.
